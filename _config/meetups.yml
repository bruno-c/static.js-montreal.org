    synopsis: Developing rich, Web-based user interfaces can be challenging due to the complex behavioural relationships between UI components, which are often difficult to express, and are even more difficult to encode and maintain. An elegant solution may be found in Model-Driven Engineering. In particular, Statecharts, a formalism for describing complex, reactive, timed, state-based behaviour, is highly suited to model UI behaviour. This presentation will discuss the SCXML JavaScript Code Generation Framework (scxml-js), a Statechart-to-JavaScript compiler, and how it may be used to accelerate the development of fast, robust, and richly interactive Web-based UIs

    synopsis: Steve's going to show us how to get started building web apps using Node, Express and Jade. We'll also see explore some of the tools useful for Node development and a demonstration of Node's asynchronous nature through a small crawler program Steve has built. Exceptionally this month, there will be only one presentation because there is a lot of material to cover. And plenty of time for questions.

  blurb: This month it's all about Node. If you still haven't had the chance to build something with Node, this month's presentation will be a good introduction to everything you need to know to get started. Node is no longer on the fringe. With the support and endorsement of giants like Microsoft, Yahoo, eBay, Joyent, LinkedIn - Node's time to hit the mainstream is imminent. Come see what all the fuss is about and leave with enough knowledge to hit the ground running.
